        "OPPs\n",
        "\n",
        "Q1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "  - Solution-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm which organizes software design around objects rather than functions and logic\n",
        "  \n",
        "Q2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "  - Solution- A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of objects, including their attributes (data) and methods (functions).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "  - Solution – An object is an instance of a class that encapsulates both data (attributes) and behavior (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "  - Solution -Abstraction focuses on hiding complex implementation details and showing only the relevant features of an object. On the other hand, Encapsulation focuses on restricting direct access to the internal details of an object to maintain security and integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "  - Solution- Dunder methods, also known as magic methods, are special methods in Python that begin and end with double underscores. We can customize how objects behave in certain situations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "  - Solution- Inheritance in OOPs is a mechanism where a new class (subclass or child class) can inherit properties and methods from an existing class (superclass or parent class).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "  - Solution- It enables one interface to be used for different data types or classes, making code more flexible and reusable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "  - Solution- We can do this bt restricting access to attributes and methods, effectively hiding the internal state of an object and preventing unintended external modifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "  - Solution -It is a special method within a class that initializes the attributes of an object when the object is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "  - Solution -Class Methods:\n",
        "-bound to the class and not the instance of the class.\n",
        "-can access and modify class-level attributes\n",
        "-defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "-called using the class name, e.g., ClassName.method()\n",
        "Static Methods:\n",
        "-not bound to the class or the instance.\n",
        "-do not receive any special first argument.\n",
        "-are defined using the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "-are called using the class name, e.g., ClassName.method().\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "  - Solution -Method overloading refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name within a class, but with different parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "  - Solution -Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "  - Solution - A property decorator allows methods to be accessed like attributes. It gives a way to encapsulate the logic for getting, setting, and deleting an attribute within a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "  - Solution - It enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type, promoting code reusability, flexibility, and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "  - Solution - It is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and serves as a blueprint for other classes. It defines a common interface for a group of related classes and ensures that subclasses implement specific methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "  - Solution – OOPs offers several advantages, primarily enhancing code organization, reusability, and maintainability\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "  - Solution -Major difference between a class variable and an instance variable is their scope and how they are shared.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "  - Solution - In Python this is a feature that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "  - Solution -the __str__ and __repr__ methods are special methods used to define how objects are represented as strings.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "  - Solution -Some of the significances are-\n",
        "Calling Parent Class Methods: It allows a subclass to invoke methods from its parent class without explicitly naming the parent class.\n",
        "Avoiding Redundant Code: Instead of rewriting the parent class's logic, super() helps reuse existing functionality, reducing duplication.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - Solution - The __del__ method in Python, also known as a destructor, is called when an object is garbage collected.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "  - Solution - @staticmethod:\n",
        "It's essentially a regular function placed inside a class for organizational purposes\n",
        "It belongs to the class but does not have access to the class itself instances.\n",
        "It cannot modify the class or object state.\n",
        "@classmethod:\n",
        "It can access and modify class-level attributes\n",
        "It is bound to the class and not the instance of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "  - Solution -Polymorphism, meaning \"many forms,\" enables objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own specific ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "  - Solution -It is a programming used in object-oriented programming where multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object in a single statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - Solution - The __call__ method enables instances of a class to be called like regular functions. When a class defines the __call__ method, its instances become callable objects.\n"
